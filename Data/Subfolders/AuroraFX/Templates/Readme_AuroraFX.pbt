    Description: "AuroraFX brings RGB Lighting to Core Objects, this includes Lights, Materials and UI Controls. No programming knowledge is required, simply drag either AuroraGeneric or AuroraMaterial into the hierachy and add a reference to an object that contains the Core Objects you want to have RGB onto the ComponentGroup property. If you are a programmer however, feel free to reference the module included which holds the basic functionality for color shifting to use in your own way. A ReadMe is included that gives further details on how to use AuroraFX along with some tips.\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me @iExpulsion#2926 on Discord for any questions, suggestions or feedback. :)"
